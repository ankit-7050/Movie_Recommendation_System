# Movie_Recommendation_System
A movie recommendation system is a technology that suggests movies to users based on their preferences, interests, and past viewing behavior. It utilizes data analysis, machine learning, and collaborative filtering techniques to provide personalized movie recommendations.

The process of movie recommendation begins with data collection, which involves gathering information about movies, such as genres, actors, directors, release years, ratings, and user reviews. Additional data sources may include user profiles, historical viewing patterns, and feedback. This data forms the foundation for training the recommendation model.
